Viewcasts is the program for visualization of simulation results.
It visualizes the data from a Finite Volume or Finite Element simulations.
Currently uses proprietary format, but I plan to change it to use some
of the open source formats like NetCDF, Gmsh etc.

It uses OpenMotif and X windows library for interface and OpenGL for 
graphics primitives.
