    This is an opengl implementation of ipaste which relies solely on xlib.  
    Included are the necessary incarnations of the three libgutil files:  
    fastimg.c, file.c, and misc.c needed by ipaste.  Some additional headers
    from ../include are referenced.  (ipaste_ogl.sh is a simple try-it-out
    script.)
